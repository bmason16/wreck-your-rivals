# wreck-your-rivals
This is basically a whack-a-mole game.  You will choose your rival team and then using your mouse you will click on your rival teamâ€™s image when it pops out of one of the five boxes.  You want to avoid clicking on the basketball.  Clicking on your rival team results in a hit while not clicking on your rival team before it disappears or clicking on the basketball results in a miss.

All sounds and some sprites were found on the scratch site.  The other sprites were made from images found at the following links.
